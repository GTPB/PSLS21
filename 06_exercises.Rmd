On the third day of the "Practical Statistics for the Life Sciences (2021)" 
course, we will have two tutorials on data linear regression, based on different 
datasets:


# The poison dataset:

In this experiment, 96 fish (dojofish, goldfish and zebrafish)
were placed separately in a tank with two litres of water and
a certain dose (in mg) of a certain poison EI-43,064. The resistance
of the fish a against the poison was measured as the amount of
minutes the fish survived upon adding the poison (Surv_time, in
minutes). Additionally, the weight of each fish was measured.

In this tutorial, we will study the association between dose and survival time
by using a linear regression model.

# The FEV dataset:

The FEV, which is an acronym for forced expiratory volume,
is a measure of how much air a person can exhale (in litres) 
during  a forced breath. In this dataset, the FEV of 606 children,
between the ages of 6 and 17, were measured. The dataset
also provides additional information on these children:
their `age`, their `height`, their `gender` and, most
importantly, whether the child is a smoker or a non-smoker.

The overarching goal of this experiment was to find out if
smoking has an effect on the FEV of children.

# The puromycin dataset

Data on the velocity of an enzymatic reaction were obtained by Treloar (1974).  
The number of counts per minute of radioactive product from the reaction was 
measured as a function of substrate concentration in parts per million (ppm) 
and from these counts the initial rate (or velocity) of the reaction was 
calculated (counts/min/min). The experiment was conducted once with the enzyme 
treated with Puromycin, and once with the enzyme untreated.

The goal is to assess if there is an association between the substrate 
concentration and rate for the **treated** enzyme.
