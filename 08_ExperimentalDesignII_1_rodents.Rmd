# Power

The power of a test is defined as:

$$P(p < 
\alpha | H_1)$$
This is the probability to reject the nulhypothesis at the significance level $\alpha$ given that the alternative hypothesis is true. 

The power depends on:

- the real effect size in the population $\mathbf{L}^T\boldsymbol{\beta}$.
- the number of observations: SE and df.
- Choice of designpoints 
- Choice of significance-level $\alpha$. 

We will evaluate the power using simulation.

# Rodents

A biologist examined the effect of a fungal infection on the eating behavior of rodents. 
Infected apples were offered to a group of eight rodents, and sterile apples were offered to a group of 4 rodents. The amount of grams of apples consumed per kg body weight are given in the dataset below. 

```{r}
rodents <- data.frame(weight = c(11,33,48,34,112,369,64,44,177,80,141,332),
                      group = as.factor(c(rep("treat",8), rep("ctrl",4))))
rodents 
```

## Data exploration

Make visualizations: boxplot and QQ-plot.

```{r}

```

In the data exploration we do not have enough data to evaluate the assumptions.

Suppose that the assumptions are valid and that standard deviation in the
population would be equal to the ones you observed in the experiment.

# Assess the effect of fungal infection on apple consumption

We will model the data using a linear model with one dummy variable. Test the
relevant model parameter.

```{r}

```

# Power analyses

## Question 1

What is the power of the experiment if the effect size and standard deviation 
in the population would be equal to the ones you observed in the experiment?

## Simulation function

We provide you with a function to simulate data similar to that of our 
experiment under our model assumptions. 

```{r}
simFast <- function(form, data, betas, sd, contrasts, alpha = .05, nSim = 10000)
{
    ySim <- rnorm(nrow(data)*nSim,sd=sd)
    dim(ySim) <-c(nrow(data),nSim)
    design <- model.matrix(form, data)
    ySim <- ySim + c(design %*%betas)
    ySim <- t(ySim)
  
    ### Fitting
    fitAll <- limma::lmFit(ySim,design)
  
    ### Inference
    varUnscaled <- c(t(contrasts)%*%fitAll$cov.coefficients%*%contrasts)
    contrasts <- fitAll$coefficients %*%contrasts
    seContrasts <- varUnscaled^.5*fitAll$sigma
    tstats <- contrasts/seContrasts
    pvals <- pt(abs(tstats),fitAll$df.residual,lower.tail = FALSE)*2
    return(mean(pvals < alpha))
}
```

Without going into the full code details, this function allows us to simulate 
data similar to that of our experiment under our model assumptions, given the 
following inputs:

- `form`: model formula for the experiment we want to simulate
- `data`: the target dataset on which we want to base our simulations on
- `betas`: the linear regression coefficients for the target dataset
- `sd`: the residual standard errors from the linear regression model fit on 
the target dataset
- `contrasts`: comparison of interest, i.e. which (combination of) model 
parameters we would like to assess
- `alpha`: alpha-level at which to conduct the hypothesis testing
- `nSim`: number of datasets we would like to simulate

To simulate new data based on our target dataset `รง`, we will need to 
fill in all the arguments to the `simFast` function.

**Hint: for the betas and sd, we will need to fit a linear model first!**

```{r, eval=FALSE}
power1 <- simFast(form = ..., 
                  data = ..., 
                  betas = ..., 
                  sd = ..., 
                  contrasts = ..., 
                  alpha = ..., 
                  nSim = ...)
power1
```

Interpret the outcome.

## Question 2

What would the power by if number of rodents would  balanced in both groups?
Again, we simulate a large number of new experiments. Adjust one more more
of the inputs to the `simFast` to allow for addressing this question.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
power2 <- simFast(form = ..., 
                  data = ..., 
                  betas = ..., 
                  sd = ..., 
                  contrasts = ..., 
                  alpha = ..., 
                  nSim = ...)
power2
```

## Question 3

How many observations would you need to pick up the treatment effect with 
a power of 90%?

This will require us to establish a relationship between sample size and power.
In turn, this will require us to perform a "parameter sweep" over different
values of sample size and compute the power for each of them.

```{r}

```

## Question 4

Suppose that we would like to pick up an effect size of $\beta_1 = 60 g/kg$. 
How many samples would be required in each group to obtain a power of 90%?

Note, that 

- we do a two-sided test so the sign of the effect size is arbitrary. 
- the intercept in the power analysis is also arbitrary so we could also set it at 0. 

```{r}

```
